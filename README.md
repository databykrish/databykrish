## 🤝 What I Can Do For You

If you’re hiring for **Data, AI, or Product-driven roles**, here’s what working with me looks like:

- I help you **see what’s actually happening in your business**  
  by turning messy data into clean, decision-ready dashboards and insights.

- I don’t build AI for hype — I build it for **use**  
  practical, explainable ML solutions that solve real problems in healthcare, operations, and analytics.

- I think beyond analysis and code  
  I ask *why*, define the right KPIs, and focus on **outcomes that matter to users and stakeholders**.

- I can own problems end-to-end  
  from understanding the business context → working with data → building models or dashboards → communicating clear recommendations.

- I’m easy to work with across teams  
  I translate technical insights into simple stories that non-technical decision-makers can act on.

If you need someone who can **bridge data, AI, and product thinking**, I’m ready to contribute.
